We recently got the news that the [Austin Rodeo is cancelled][rodeo]. I can't believe it's 2021 and we're still doing the whole pandemic thing. But shortly after the bad news, [KOKEFM][kokefm] made the announcement that [KOKEFEST][kokefest] is back!

In my opinion, KOKEFEST beats [Lone Star Jam][lsj] when it comes to the best Texas country music festival around Austin. The food and vendors are top notch, the location is amazing, and they even have a dance floor!

It will be held in the same location, Hutto Park at Brushy Creek, on August 6th and 7th. Keep listening to [KOKEFM][kokefm] and checking the [KOKEFEST][kokefest] website for the artist lineup and ticket sales.
