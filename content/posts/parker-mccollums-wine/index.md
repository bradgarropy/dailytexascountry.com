So it looks like [Parker McCollum][parker] is making wine now?! Two days ago Parker announced on social media that he'll be releasing a wine called _To Be Loved By You_. It's a Cabernet Sauvignon with a red wax coated cork.

Parker joins the likes of [George Strait][george-strait] and [Jon Wolfe][jon-wolfe], who have their own line of tequila. But it makes sense that Parker would brand a wine, as he's quite the ladies' man. While this is the first alcoholic beverage with his name on it, it's not the first one he's promoted. The [Young Man's Blues][young-mans-blues] video featured [Ranch Water][ranch-water], which is fucking delicious.

This is cool and all, but I don't really drink wine. So I'm just excited he's [back in the studio][studio] making more music.
