The only reason I'd heard of [Pecos & the Rooftops][pecos] was because they played some shows with [Kolby Cooper][kolby-cooper]. I never gave them much thought until [_This Damn Song_][this-damn-song] came across my radar. As it turns out, this song was the first piece of music the band had ever released, and it's a hit! With 5.8 million plays on Spotify and 3.2 million views on YouTube it brought a lot of attention to the band.

They followed up the single with a six track EP called [Red Eye][red-eye] which didn't resonate as well with listeners, and myself, as much as _This Damn Song_ did. Regardless, I'm excited to catch a show and see how they ride out this early success.
