[Kolby Cooper][kolby-cooper] hasn't put out a song I didn't like, and [Vol. 2][vol-2] is no exception. While I was a little disappointed that the record was only five songs, every one hit for me and I enjoyed every second of it.

The record kicks off with the much anticipated _2 Words_, a song Kolby [teased][teaser] a few months ago. It's a breakup song with attitude and explicit lyrics, exactly what I like to hear. I can already hear crowds yelling "then fuck you" at shows.

The next song, _One Night Stand_, kicks off with a groovy rhythm that really took me by surprise. It's got a playful tune with some clever wordplay that shows promise in Kolby's writing. He even brings in some humor with the line about "casual encounters."

I'd consider _What've I Got To Lose_ my least favorite song on the record. It comes in a little weak musically and there's something about the banjo breaks that remind me of bro country from five years ago. The lines that repeat "on the couch" don't flow as well as they could have.

_If I Still Had It_ was released as a single before rest of the album, and I totally understand why. It's an emotional song that has highs and lows, particularly in the transition from the guitar solo to the acoustic bridge. Cooper shows off his musical prowess and depth in this track.

The album wraps up with _Cannonball_, a hopeful end to a record focused on breakups and past relationships. _Cannonball_ hits hard from the first line and encourages folks to "jump in" and take risks to get what you want. The second verse is the highlight of _Vol. 2_. Cooper's delivery of the line "no matter what you do don't slow down" sits in the shadow of the thought that "every road's got an end you don't really wanna see."

Congratulations to [Kolby Cooper][kolby-cooper] on this release! I expect to see lots more great music from you in the future.
