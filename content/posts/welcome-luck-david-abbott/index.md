Congratulations to [Josh][josh] and [Taylor][taylor] Abbott on their new baby boy! Luck David Abbott was born on June 10th, measuring 9 pounds and 20.5 inches. Luck brings the Abbotts to a family of four. Their first child is a girl by the name of [Emery Farryn][emery].

While the name Luck is definitely unique, it's a phrase we've heard mentioned a lot recently with [Josh Abbott Band][jab]. They released a new single called [_The Luckiest_][luckiest], a song about being grateful for the simple things. I wonder if the song had anything to do with naming the baby?
