With nothing but a single post on [Twitter][twitter] and [Instagram][instagram] for marketing, [Parker McCollum][parker] kicked off 2021 strong with the brand new single _To Be Loved By You_. Only one week later it's got 100k views on [YouTube][youtube] and 486k streams on [Spotify][spotify].

What a way to celebrate the New Year! But don't get me wrong, I've been waiting for [this song][post] for a long time. Personally though, I like the [live][live] [versions][versions] better.

The constant, driving, acoustic strumming creates a bit of tension that reflects in the lyrics. The album version removes the acoustic guitar almost entirely and relies on the backbeat to carry the verses forward. Not to mention there's just something about the rhythm guitar in all of his new songs that comes across as too high pitched for me.

Regardless, with his recent singles and the [Hollywood Gold EP][ep], I'm assuming he'll drop a full album here soon. Now let's just hope he records [Dallas][dallas] for it.
