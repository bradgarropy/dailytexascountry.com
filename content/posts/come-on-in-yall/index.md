Hey y'all, welcome to [Daily Texas Country][dtxc]!

Daily Texas Country was created out of love for Texas country music, and formed around our [Spotify playlist][spotify-playlist]. We've got a collection of over 1,000 tracks, so you'll never run out of songs to listen to. If you just can't choose, we post one song every day on our [Twitter][twitter], or you can explore some of our other hand picked [playlists][playlists].

If you're looking for an excuse to drink whiskey, look no further. Check out [Whiskey Wednesday][whiskey-wednesday] on our [YouTube][youtube] channel. It's a weekly series where I listen to the daily song, tell you what I think about it, and share some stories. Trust me, I've got some.

And if you really like what we're doing here, head over to our [store][store]. Spread the love for Texas country music with some Daily Texas Country apparel.
