[Casey Donahew][cdb] did his fair share of livestreams during quarantine, but all were acoustic performances with his fiddler. Well, Casey did something special to close down 2020: a full band show, livestreamed for free on New Year's Eve!

He played a full set, lasting just over an hour. Nowadays Casey's set plays like a greatest hits album. He gave his classic [2nd Amendement][2nd] speech, which may be more important now than ever before. As expected, he played [3AM by Matchbox Twenty][3am], and even threw in a [Dropkick Murphys][boston] lick to end the show.

I can't really get out to shows right now, so this was prime entertainment. Besides, it was way better than watching an empty [Times Square][square] ball drop.

**Happy New Year y'all!**
