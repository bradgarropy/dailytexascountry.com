Dancing has been an obsession since I first stepped foot into Midnight Rodeo years ago. One step, two step, half step, I love it all. I met my [wife][wife] at a country bar when she asked me for a dance! We found our home at [Maverick's Dance Hall][mavericks] in Austin and met the whole crew there.
