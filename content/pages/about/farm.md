I grew up on dairy farm in upstate New York. I was always riding around in my grandpa's red Chevy Silverado or a John Deere tractor with country music playing on the radio. If that doesn't sound like a country song I don't know what does! My earliest memories of country music were George Strait, Alan Jackson, Garth Brooks, Brooks & Dunn, Billy Ray Cyrus, and Shania Twain.
